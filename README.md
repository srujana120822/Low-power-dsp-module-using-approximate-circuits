# Low-power-dsp-module-using-approximate-circuits
This project focuses on designing a low-power DSP moduleâ€”specifically a MAC unitâ€”using approximate adders. Approximate adders reduce power, area, and delay by allowing small errors in computation.
Low Power DSP Module Using Approximate Circuits
This project explores the design and implementation of low-power Digital Signal Processing (DSP) modules using approximate computing techniques. It is aimed at achieving energy-efficient computation for signal processing tasks without significantly compromising output accuracy â€” a trade-off acceptable in many DSP applications like image/audio processing, edge computing, and IoT systems.

ðŸ§  Project Objective
To develop and evaluate low-power MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) and other DSP modules using approximate arithmetic units such as:

Approximate Adders (e.g., LOA, ETA, Hybrid Adders)
Approximate Multipliers
Hybrid Approximate-Exact Designs

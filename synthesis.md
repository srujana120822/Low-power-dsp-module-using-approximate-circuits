synthesis output
 Objective:

      To evaluate the hardware cost of the accurate and approximate DSP modules after synthesis in terms of area, power, and timing.

ðŸ”¸ Key Activities:

Synthesized the RTL design using a standard-cell library.

Analyzed post-synthesis reports for:

Area (ÂµmÂ²)

Power consumption (mW)

Timing delay (ns)

Cell count
